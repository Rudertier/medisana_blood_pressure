The timeout error you're experiencing suggests there might be several potential issues to investigate:

1. **Bluetooth Connection Issues:**
   - The error shows a timeout while trying to connect to device D0:5F:B8:14:A0:BE after 10 seconds
   - This could indicate either distance/signal strength issues or interference problems
   - Try to ensure the blood pressure monitor is very close to your Home Assistant device during synchronization
   - Check if there are any sources of bluetooth interference nearby

2. **Device State:**
   - Remember that the Medisana device is only active for a short period after measurements
   - From the README: "The Medisana Blood Pressure Monitor is only active and reachable for a short period after a measurement is completed"
   - Make sure you're trying to sync immediately after taking a measurement
   - The LED on the device should be blinking to indicate it's in sync mode

3. **Bluetooth Stack:**
   - Check if your Home Assistant bluetooth adapter is working properly
   - You can verify this in HA Developer Tools -> States by searching for 'bluetooth'
   - Make sure no other device is connected to the blood pressure monitor at the same time

4. **Debug Mode:**
   If the issue persists, you can enable debug logging by adding this to your configuration.yaml:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       custom_components.medisana_blood_pressure: debug
       bleak_esphome: debug
   ```

5. **Data Recovery:**
   - From the documentation: "Sometimes the synchronization fails; however, the data is not lost. It will be transferred the next time"
   - Your measurements should still be stored in the device and will sync when the connection succeeds

Please try these steps and let me know the results. If you enable debug logging, please share the logs from when you attempt to sync after a new measurement.

Version 0.3.0 is fairly recent - have you tried with the latest version 0.3.2?
